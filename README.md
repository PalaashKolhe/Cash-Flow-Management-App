# Cash Flow Management App

## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project arose from the glace that we all have when we open our credit statement and come to terms with our 3 figure grocery bill. Since cash is becoming more and more uncommon, we often fall to the demise of swiping our bank accounts away. This app is an attempt to combat this problem that almost any shopper can relate to and raise awareness for smart money management.

## What it does
The app captures a picture of a receipt and interprets the price of each item and categorizes the item to a more general sub-section.

## How we built it
This project was made by a team of 3. The primary development platform we used was the Android Studio. For text-recognition software, we used Firebase's OCR script for optimal compatibility. 

## Challenges we ran into
The **FirebaseVision library** was recently deprecated and most forums online did not reflect this. So we had to thoroughly research the alternative **Firebase Text Recognition library** and put bits and pieces from different websites together to make this app work. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Our team is proud of developing the app interface in a limited time period. As first-year undergraduate students, a big part of this project was self-learning how to code through free tutorials online. We had no experience in Java / android studio prior to this.

## What we learned
We learned how to work with Android Studio, the Firebase Platform, and Java. 

## What's next for our app
For the future of this project, we plan to add additional categories for items and a feature to store purchases. By incorporating a purchase history, the user will be able to track their long-term spendings and notice any particular trends in buying habits.
